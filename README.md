# PHP x Android Java Ciphers

In reference to https://github.com/chaudhuri-ab/CrossPlatformCiphers and a post from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44234719/encryption-between-php-java, this repo contains a working PHP encryption that works with Android Java decryption.
Take note that the iv and key should be the same for this to work vice-versa.
